# Web_Eng_Classwork

In this Repo I am going to maintain a record of all the classwork we have done in the classroom from small tasks to the Assignments assigned to us

This Repo is entirely focused on Web development concepts including the basics of HTML, CSS, JQUERY, AJAX and then eventually the MERN stack

In the first few files I have attempted to make a simple form using HTML and CSS

Another attempt was made to make a Piano using the basic stack 

In the third partI tried to replicate a page on Khan-Academy

Today I started off with the First Question of the Second Assignment. I have made just entered the Input fields of the Simple Wish List and the Add button the changes hsve been commited
